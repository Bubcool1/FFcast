ffcast - screencast an interactively selected region

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=over 4

=item B<ffcast> [<options>] [<geospec>] B<%> [<command> [<args>]]

=item B<ffcast> [<options>] [<geospec>] [<command> [<args>] [B<-->] [<args>]]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

ffcast is a thin glue between interactive region selection and command line
tools that accept numerical geometry parameters. It makes passing geometry
parameters to command line tools as easy as a mouse click. Screencasting
tools are typical examples of such command line tools.

Typically, ffcast prompts the user to select a screen region and injects the
geometry parameters thereof into the arguments of I<E<lt>commandE<gt>>, and
then executes the resultant command line.

The first form is called the B<format string syntax>. Format strings in
I<E<lt>argsE<gt>> are substituted with the corresponding geometry parameters.
See B<L<FORMAT STRINGS|/FORMAT STRINGS>>.

The second form is called the B<double hyphen syntax>. Only a limited set of
commands are recognized. A set of geometry-related arguments specific to
I<E<lt>commandE<gt>> are inserted in place of the first argument that is
`B<-->', or if `B<-->' is not found, immediately after I<E<lt>commandE<gt>>.
I<E<lt>argsE<gt>> are left as they are specified.

If I<E<lt>commandE<gt>> is not given, a default B<ffmpeg> command line is
used.

=head1 OPTIONS

Any of the I<E<lt>optionsE<gt>> can be repeated. They are parsed and applied
in the order they are specified.

=over 4

=item B<-b>

Include borders of windows to be selected.

=item B<-h>

Print help message, then exit.

=item B<-l>

List commands recognized by the B<double hyphen syntax>, then exit.

=item B<-m> I<E<lt>nE<gt>>

Trim both dimensions of the region to be divisible by I<E<lt>nE<gt>>. By
default, both dimensions are trimmed to be divisible by C<2>, which is
required by B<x264>. A value of C<16> may help when encoding to most video
codecs. A value of C<1> disables trimming.

=item B<-p>

Print geometry of the selected region and exit without executing
I<E<lt>commandE<gt>>. The dimensions are not trimmed.

=item B<-q>

Be less verbose.

=item B<-s>

Prompt to select a region.

=item B<-v>

Be more verbose.

=item B<-w>

Prompt to select a window.

=head1 FORMAT STRINGS

The B<format string syntax> defines the following format strings:

=over 4

=item B<%d>

B<DISPLAY>

=item B<%h>

Height

=item B<%w>

Width

=item B<%x>

Left offset

=item B<%y>

Top offset

=item B<%X>

Right offset

=item B<%Y>

Bottom offset

=item B<%%>

A literal %

=head1 GEOMETRY SPECIFICATION

The I<E<lt>geospecE<gt>> specifies a geometry in one of the following forms:

=over 4

=item S<I<x>B<,>I<y> I<X>B<,>I<Y>>

I<x>, I<y>, I<X> and I<Y> are the left, top, right and bottom offsets,
respectively.

=item I<w>B<x>I<h>B<+>I<x>B<+>I<y>

I<w>, I<h>, I<x> and I<y> are the width, height and left and right offsets,
respectively.

=head1 EXAMPLES

Use the recognized command B<ffmpeg> in the B<double hyphen syntax>, with
debug messages printed to stderr:

    ffcast -vvs ffmpeg -r 30 -- -vcodec libx264 out.mkv

Screencast fullscreen on display C<:1>, using the default B<ffmpeg> command
line:

    DISPLAY=:1 ffcast

Screencast all three windows of B<GIMP>:

    ffcast -www % ffmpeg -f x11grab -show_region 1 -s %wx%h -i %d+%x,%y out.mpg
