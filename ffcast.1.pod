=head1 NAME

ffcast - screencast an interactively selected region

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=over 4

=item B<ffcast> [<options>] [<sub-command> [<args>]] [<command> [<args>]]

=back

=head1 DESCRIPTION

ffcast is a thin glue between interactive region selection and command line
tools that accept numerical geometry parameters. It makes passing geometry
parameters to command line tools as easy as a mouse click. Screencasting
tools are typical examples of such command line tools.

Typically, ffcast prompts the user to select a screen region and injects the
geometry parameters thereof into the arguments of I<E<lt>commandE<gt>>, and
then executes the resultant command line. This injection is done via format
string substitution. See B<L<FORMAT STRINGS|/FORMAT STRINGS>>.

ffcast maintains an internal list of predefined B<sub-commands>, which is
looked up before all external commands. Use the B<help> sub-command to get a
list of all sub-commands. To bypass sub-command lookup, use the B<%>
sub-command. It's possible to add or override sub-commands via user
configuration. See B<L<SUB-COMMANDS|/SUB-COMMANDS>>.

If neither I<E<lt>sub-commandE<gt>> nor I<E<lt>commandE<gt>> is given, the
geometry of the selection is printed.

=head1 OPTIONS

Any of the I<E<lt>optionsE<gt>> can be repeated. They are parsed and applied
in the order they are specified.

=over 4

=item B<-#> I<E<lt>nE<gt>>

Select window with ID I<E<lt>nE<gt>>.

=item B<-b>

Include borders of windows to be selected.

=item B<-f>

Include window manager frame of windows to be selected. The window manager
must support B<_NET_FRAME_EXTENTS>.

=item B<-g> I<E<lt>geospecE<gt>>

Specify a selection in I<E<lt>geospecE<gt>>.
See B<L<GEOMETRY SPECIFICATION|/GEOMETRY SPECIFICATION>>.

=item B<-h>

Print help message, then exit.

=item B<-i>

Combine selected regions by intersection instead of union.

=item B<-q>

Be less verbose.

=item B<-s>

Prompt to select a region.

=item B<-v>

Be more verbose.

=item B<-w>

Prompt to select a window.

=item B<-x> I<E<lt>nE<gt>>

Select a B<Xinerama> head of ID I<E<lt>nE<gt>>. Multiple heads can be
specified either as a comma-separated list, or by repeating this option. Use
C<list> or C<l> to get a list of head IDs and the corresponding geometry
parameters.

=head1 FORMAT STRINGS

All I<E<lt>argsE<gt>> to an external I<E<lt>commandE<gt>> are always subject
to format string substitution.

Note I<E<lt>argsE<gt>> to an internal I<E<lt>sub-commandE<gt>> are not
automatically subject to format string substitution, although sub-commands may
choose to do format string substitution on their own.

The following format strings are supported:

=over 4

=item B<%D>

B<DISPLAY>

=item B<%h>

Height

=item B<%w>

Width

=item B<%x>

Left offset

=item B<%y>

Top offset

=item B<%X>

Right offset

=item B<%Y>

Bottom offset

=item B<%c>

Equivalent to B<%x,%y>

=item B<%C>

Equivalent to B<%X,%Y>

=item B<%g>

Equivalent to B<%wx%h+%x+%y>

=item B<%s>

Equivalent to B<%wx%h>

=item B<%%>

A literal %

=head1 GEOMETRY SPECIFICATION

A I<E<lt>geospecE<gt>> specifies a geometry in one of the following forms:

=over 4

=item S<I<x>B<,>I<y> I<X>B<,>I<Y>>

I<x>, I<y>, I<X> and I<Y> are the left, top, right and bottom offsets,
respectively.

=item I<w>B<x>I<h>B<+>I<x>B<+>I<y>

I<w>, I<h>, I<x> and I<y> are the width, height and left and right offsets,
respectively.

=back

=head1 SUB-COMMANDS

To import sub-commands, ffcast B<source>s the files I</usr/lib/ffcast/subcmd>,
I</etc/ffcast/subcmd> and I<$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ffcast/subcmd>, in that order.

To learn how to register a sub-command, refer to I</usr/lib/ffcast/subcmd>.

=head1 EXAMPLES

List all sub-commands with brief description:

    ffcast help

Use the sub-command B<png> to take a screenshot of a window, including its
window manager frame. Note the B<png> sub-command supports format string
substitution:

    ffcast -fw png screenshot-%s.png

The B<-f> option works only if the window manager supports
B<_NET_FRAME_EXTENTS>. A workaround is to use the B<pad> sub-command to
explicitly pad the region with the size of the frame:

    ffcast -w pad '20 2 2' png screenshot_%s.png

Use the sub-command B<rec> to record a fullscreen screencast on display C<:1>.
The B<rec> sub-command accepts the B<-m> option, which crops the video so
both its width and height are divisible by the given number:

    DISPLAY=:1 ffcast -vv rec -m 4 screencast.mkv

Record a screencast of all three windows of B<GIMP>. This works because all
selections are by default combined by union. Note format strings are always
substituted for external commands:

    ffcast -www ffmpeg -f x11grab -show_region 1 -s %s -i %D+%c gimp.mp4

Resize a window to the same size as another, by two mouse clicks:

    ffcast -w xdotool selectwindow windowsize %w %h windowfocus

Take a screenshot of two windows combined, excluding anything invisible on
head 0, using either of:

    ffcast -i -x 0 -g "$(ffcast -ww)" png
    ffcast -ww ffcast -i -x 0 -g %g png

Take three individual screenshots of heads 0, 1, 2, one by one. The B<each>
command runs a command for each user selection consecutively:

    ffcast -x 0,1,2 each png head_%g.png
